    <h1>Starting a Node</h1>
    <p>This dapp requires a node to be running. You may find a puplically available node such as <code>rnode-test.rhobot.net</code> useful. Or you may consider the following and start your own local node.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Required: Node must be a validator. Private keys are available in <code>./rnode/genesis</code></li>
      <li>Required: Node must have non-zero weight. Using an above key ensures this.</li>
      <li>Suggestion: Standalone nodes are easier to start for testing purposes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This example command will work in most cases.<br  />
      <code>rnode run -s -n --validator-private-key bc6391d3acdd9135dde2a0eafdd2f4d9edb10111efff5d72563b10a69e936535</code></p>
    <button id="start-node">Attempt to Start Local Node</button>

    <h1>Register for Status</h1>
    <p>Enter a name that you want to go by. This name is the channel on which you will send commands to update and check your status. This is a huge security hole, and in a future release, we will use unforgeable names, but RNode does not have a working name registry yet.</p>
    <input id="name" type="text" />
    <button id="register">Register</button>
    <p id="result"></p>

    <h1>Your User Controls</h1>
    TODO Show current status, set new status

    <h1>Check friend's satus</h1>
    TODO Box for friend's name, and then show their status

    <h1>Force propose</h1>
    <p>If your node is taking too long to propose a block, you can force it.</p>
    <button id="propose">Propose</button>
